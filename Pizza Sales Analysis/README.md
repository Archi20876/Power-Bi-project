- Is there any drop of sales within any month?
  
  There is a noticeable drop in orders in September (1,661), which might require investigation to understand the cause, such as seasonality, competition, or other external factors.


### Recommendations
---

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
-  Target Friday with special offers or combo deals, as it has the highest order volume. Also, consider offering promotions during the slower months, like September, to boost sales.
-  Investigate the drop in September sales to understand customer behavior or external factors affecting demand.
-  Brie Carre Pizza might need a recipe change or marketing effort to boost its popularity.
-  Explore combo deals or family packs, leveraging the high average pizzas per order.
