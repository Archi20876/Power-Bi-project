3. Performed DAX Query.
4. Data cleaning and formatting.
   

### Bussiness Analysis Q/A
---

In this project, We utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data, addressing key business questions and answers such as:

- Who is the Top Customer by revenue?
  ##### Jamora Chand , Customer ID = TC-20980
- Which Products Or Categories generating the highest revenue?
  ##### Technology , Product ID = TEC-CO-10004722
- Are there any customer segment that are outperforming?
  ##### 1.Segment
  ##### 2.Consumer
  ##### 3.Corporate
  ##### 4.Home Office
- Which Product having highest order sale?
  #####  California
- Which product has the lowest sale?
  ##### Avery Durable Slant Ring Binders With Label Holder, Product ID = OFF-BI-10003727
- Was there any anomalies in the sales?
  ##### Sum of Sales was unexpectedly high on Friday, December 25, 2020. It had a value of 9721.93, which is outside the expected range of 8076.68-9665.15.
- In which region the anomalies were seen?
  ##### Sum of Sales for Region South was unusually high, which may have lifted the Sum of Sales total.
- What are the Trends that can be seen from Forecast?
  ##### Sum of Sales trended up between Thursday, August 13, 2020 and Tuesday, September 22, 2020 with a rise of 5769.05.
- What might be the reason for the upward trend?
  ##### 'Second Class' accounted for the majority of the increase among Ship Mode , offsetting the decrease of 'Standard Class'. The relative contributions made by 'Second Class' and 'Standard Class' changed the most.
  


### Recommendations
---

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- If certain products consistently have low stock levels or stock-outs, it might indicate a need for better inventory management.
- Analyze the specific needs and preferences of the Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments. Introduce new products or services that align with their demands, potentially creating new revenue streams.
- "Avery Durable Slant Ring Binders With Label Holder" (Product ID: OFF-BI-10003727) has low sales but if we offer the binder as part of a bundle with other office supplies, such as dividers, sheet protectors, or paper. Bundling can encourage customers to purchase multiple items together, increasing overall sales.
- Review the product mix available in these regions. Introduce products that align better with the needs of the local market or withdraw items that donâ€™t resonate with customers in those areas.
  

### Limitations
---

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
